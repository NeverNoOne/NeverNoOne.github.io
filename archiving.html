            What is digital archiving?
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p class="p-bold">Digital archiving is a process of preserving digital content for future use. It is important for organizations to archive
            <br>digital content to keep it safe from data loss and other disasters in order to avoid any adverse effects.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It involves many aspects such as data management, data storage, data migration, digital preservation,<br>
            metadata management and refers to information storage and management of digitized data.

            Why Is Digital Archiving Important?
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Digital archiving is important because it ensures that your business can be recovered in case<br>
            of an unforeseen event. It also ensures that you are compliant with industry regulations and standards.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It is important to archive the data so it can be easily accessed in the future. In today’s world,<br>
            there are many risks involved with data and if you don’t take care of them, they will come back to haunt you later.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Archives can be dangerous in that they are prone to tampering and destruction, as well as accidental<br>
            destruction from natural disasters. Some data is simply lost over time due to decay or due to the user’s<br>
            lack of knowledge on how long their device has been in use. Lastly, data can be lost or deleted from devices.<br>
            The only way to get data back is through backups and syncing, which also require a lot of time and resources.<br>
            This is why it’s important to have a plan in place on how you will do this.

            Digital Archiving Benefits
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are many benefits of digital archiving, including:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p-bold">
            1- Increased efficiency
            <img src="Icons/icons8-up-64.png">
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Among the top digital archiving benefits is the ability to increase operational efficiency.<br>
            Digital archiving can help organizations become more efficient by automating many of the tasks associated with managing paper records,<br>
            such as filing, retrieving, and destroying records.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p-bold">
            2- Improved access
            <img src="Icons/icons8-up-64.png">
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Digital archiving can provide anytime, anywhere access to records, which can be a major advantage for organizations that<br>
            need to share records with employees or customers located in different geographic areas.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p-bold">
            3- Enhanced security
            <img src="Icons/icons8-secure-64.png">
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Security is considered one of the top digital archiving benefits as it can help protect records from physical damage or destruction,<br>
            as well as unauthorized access.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p-bold">
            4- Cost savings
            <img src="Icons/icons8-down-64.png">
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Cost saving is also considered one of the top digital archiving benefits as it can save organizations money by reducing the need for storage space,<br>
            as well as the costs associated with managing paper records.
            <br>
            <br>
            The biggest cost savings come from not having to print documents. Printing documents can be expensive, especially if you need to print in color.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p-bold">
            5- Increased productivity
            <img src="Icons/icons8-up-64.png">
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The biggest productivity gains come from not having to search for documents. If you can find documents quickly, you can get work done faster.<br>
            This is especially important if you need to find documents that are not in your office.
